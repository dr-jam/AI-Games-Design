As discussed in class, a major area of traditional game AI is character performance. The behavior of non-player characters is shaped by the game mechanics, setting, unfolding narrative, employed AI technique, and authored behaviors. As this topic is core to the course, this response allows for you to gain some personal experience with a powerful and useful game AI technology.

The instructions are as follows:

1. [AI for Behavior: Advanced Research for Intelligent Decision Making](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdN8dDa0ff4)

2. Download and install Unity 2019.2.21 from the [Unity Archive](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive) or in the Unity Hub with this resource locator: unityhub://2019.2.21f1/9d528d026557

3. Read the (documentation for the Unity AI Planner)[https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.ai.planner@0.1/manual/index.html].

4. Clone the Otto Unity AI Planner demo repository (use the lfs option when cloning): https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/otto

5. Open and play the Otto demo in Unity 2019.2.21. Opening the project for the first time may take a while to initialize.

6. Submit answers to the questions below. Include a header in your document for each question. You can work on this in pairs if you wish to facilitate conversation, but if you do, you should both submit the reading response.

Questions:

1. In couple paragraphs, briefly summarize the Unity AI Planner and how it works. 
2. What seemed useful, powerful or otherwise interesting about the system?
3. What seems problematic, difficult, or strange about the system?
4. What could you imagine using the planner for in an AI-based game? Remember that this doesn't have to be an NPC...
5. What questions do you have about the planner and using it in an experience?
