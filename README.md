# AI, Games, and Design - ECS 289G 002, fall 2020
Syllabus and course materials for the AI, Games, and Design (ECS 289G 002 for fall quarter 2020).

## Course Description

At the intersection of computation, games, and design lies interdisciplinary problems that present
some of the most difficult challenges facing artificial intelligence. Currently, most of AI's application to
games is in the form of playing games such as AlphaStar playing StarCraft II and Counterfactual Regret Maximization solving heads-up limit hold'em poker. When the AI system is applied to design, the supporting structures such as error minimization, reward functions, and easily-quantized vector-based representation
are replaced by the contextual and subjective nature of design problems.  

This course is about the application of AI systems into game design to enhance existing games and to explore previously unreachable design spaces. Topics will include interactive storytelling, social characters, procedural content generation, and modes of interaction. The AI techniques covered are broad and may include machine learning, logic-based inference, planning, and search. Foundational and open-ended topics of AI will be discussed including knowledge representation, contextual reasoning, and the integration of approaches in AI (e.g. systems that are both statistical learnings and symbolic reasoners). Assessment will consist of a term project, smaller technical projects, and responses or reviews of research papers, videos, games, and other media.
